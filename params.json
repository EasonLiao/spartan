We are currently working hard on improving our documentation; if you're interested in the project, or want to help out, please contact us at power@cs.nyu.edu)\r\n\r\nSpartan is a distributed array language implementation, which combines a frontend compiler with dataflow execution (à la Spark) and a shared memory backend (à la Piccolo).  Spartan provides most of the basic NumPy builtin operations, which allows existing NumPy programs to be used with minimal modification.\r\n\r\nInterested?
